# Introduction to Git

## Objective

Learn the basics of Git and understand what role GitHub plays in the ecosystem of Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails. Learn concepts, such as *snapshot*, *repository*, *pull*, *push* and *topical branches*.

## Git

Git is a fast, open source, distributed version control system. It's unlike CVS, SourceSafe, ClearCase, Subversion or Perforce, and is somewhat like Mercurial (Hg). Distributed means it works offline. Git is an essential enabler of the ecosystem of Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails.

## Git Snapshots

A git commit is a snapshot of all files and meta information at a given point in time, not a file diff.

## A New Git Repository

Create a GIT repository offline. We'll call this one *red*.

```bash
$ mkdir ga
$ cd ga
ga$ mkdir red
ga$ cd red

ga/red$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/dblock/sourcega/red/.git/

ga/red$ touch README.md

ga/red$ git add README.md

ga/red$ git status

# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   README.md
#

ga/red$ git commit -m "Added README."
[master (root-commit) 3923738] Added README.
    0 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
    create mode 100644 README.md

ga/red$
```

## Exercise

Modify the contents of *README.md* in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) format and commit the changes.

## Our Local Repository

Our previous commit placed our changes into our *local* repository, a concept unique to distributed version control systems like Git and Hg.

Examine the history of this *local* repository.

```bash
ga/red$ git log

commit 392373835e0f7702251d45a088664918e9125c97
Author: dblock
Date:   Mon Dec 5 09:34:08 2011 -0500

Added README.
```

## Pushing to a Remote Repository: GitHub

[Create a new repository on GitHub](https://github.com/repositories/new) called *red*. That's an empty repository with no files. GitHub ran the same git commands as we just did on their servers.

We can connect our local *red* repository with GitHub's by adding a remote location called *origin*. This name is just a convention.

```bash
ga/red$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/red.git
```

One can now see the remote branch listed:

```bash
ga/red$ git remote
origin
```

Push all our changes to GitHub.

```bash
ga/red$ git push -u origin master
```

Next time you can push all pending changes on all branches.

```bash
ga/red$ git push
```

The opposite of *pushing* is *pulling*. The following updates the local copy to the remote changes on the *master* branch.

```bash
ga/red$ git pull origin master
```

## Cloning

Use `git clone` to get a copy of an existing GitHub repository to your local machine.

```bash
ga$ git clone git@github.com:<username>/red.git green
```

This creates a new folder called *green* with the contents of the *red* repository, a *local* repository from the *remote* repository on github.

## Topic Branches

Unlike other source controls, branches are cheap. In Git it's considered a good practice to never work on the *master* branch and create *topic branches* instead. A topic branch is created off master.

First, list your branches. You will see that you are on the *master* branch.

```bash
ga/red$ git branch
```

Ensure the *master* branch is up-to-date.

```bash
ga/red$ git pull origin master 
```

Create a new branch *readme-changes*.

```bash
ga/red$ git checkout -b readme-changes
Switched to a new branch 'readme-changes'

ga/red$ git status
# On branch readme-changes
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

Make some changes on the branch, commit them and push them to GitHub.

```bash
ga/red$ git push origin readme-changes
```

When the feature on a branch is ready, merge it to *master*.

```bash
ga/red$ git checkout master
ga/red$ git merge readme-changes
```

## Visualize the Branches

Commits add to the log inside Git, allowing one to visualize the changes to each particular branch.

```bash
ga/red$ git log --graph
```

Use the built-in GUI GitK to see this graph

```bash
ga/red$ gitk
```

## Exercise

Make a change to README in your local *red* repository in a new branch, *push* it to GitHub and *pull* the branch into your local *green* copy.

## Forking

To contribute to someone else's work, create a new *fork* via GitHub, then clone your fork to your local environment. To submit changes, make *pull requests*.

To pull changes made to the original work, one would need to set up an `upstream` remote repository.

```bash
ga/red$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:<original_author>/<upstream_source>.git

ga/red$ git remote
origin
upstream
```

To pull any changes made to upstream one would run the following command:

```bash
ga/red$ git pull upstream master
```

## Exercise

In pairs, fork each-other's repositories, clone your fork, make a change to *README.md* and create a pull request. Examine the difference on GitHub and merge the pull request. Extra points for creating a topic branch.
