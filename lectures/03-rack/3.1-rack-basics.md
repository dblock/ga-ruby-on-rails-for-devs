# Rack Basics

## Objective

Understand Rack, an essential component of Rails.

## Rack

Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. 
It includes basic implementations of request, response, cookies & sessions. And a good number of useful middlewares.

## Bundler

Bundler is a package manager that sandboxes an application or library. Libraries are called *gems*. 

Create a *Gemfile* that requires Rack and Thin, one of the many available web servers.

```ruby
source 'http://rubygems.org'

gem 'rack'
gem 'thin'
```

Install bundler with RubyGem.

```bash
gem install bundler
```

Install gems.

```bash
bundle install

Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
```

## Server

A simple Rack server responds to a single HTTP request. The `call` method takes one parameter - an environment that contains information about the HTTP request. The response from the `call` method must be an array of three elements: an HTTP return code, headers and an array of body parts.

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'rack'

class HelloWorld
  def call(env)
    [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/html"}, ["Hello Rack!"]]
  end
end

Rack::Handler::Thin.run HelloWorld.new, Port: 9292 # Remember the uppercase 'P'
```

It can be run with ruby.

```bash
ruby server.rb
```

Navigate to [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292/).

## Exercise

Build a basic web application on top of Rack that can serve simple HTML files from a subdirectory on the local file system.
