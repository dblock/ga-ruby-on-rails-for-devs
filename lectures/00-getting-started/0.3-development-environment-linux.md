# Getting Started on Linux (Ubuntu)

This should get you started on Linux.

## Package Upgrade

It may be a good idea to start by running `sudo aptitude upgrade` to get the latest versions of all current packages.

## Don't Root

Don't set up a development environment as `root`, it won't work. Be a regular person instead.

## Install Ssh

Get a working SSH client. On Ubuntu this can be done with `apt-get`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-client
```

Generate a public/private key pair.

```bash
ssh-keygen

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
```

Upload the public key (contents of ` ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to GitHub under [Account Settings, SSH Public Keys](https://github.com/account). Refer to [troubleshooting ssh issues](http://help.github.com/troubleshooting-ssh/) if you're having problems.

You should now be able to connect to GitHub.

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## Install Git

Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/download).

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

Set your username and email.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
```

## Use a Code Editor

Most developers use Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Install and run it.

## Install Ruby w/ RVM

RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and it allows you to manage multiple versions of the Ruby development environment. This is useful for projects which call for an older version of Ruby itself or another core library. It also provides an easy way to restore your environment in the case it is damaged or mistakenly updated.

Install [RVM](https://rvm.io/).

```bash
gpg2 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB

\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```

Add RVM path and initialization command to your `.bash_profile` using your favorite text editor.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/rvm/bin
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"
```

Open a new shell and test RVM. The following should return `rvm is a function`.

```bash
type rvm | head -1 # numeral one
rvm is a function
```

Install Ruby 3.4.2, RubyGems, Rails, and set up a gemset.

```bash
rvm install 3.4.2
rvm --default 3.4.2
```

## Test Ruby

```bash
ruby -e "puts :Hello"
```

This should output "Hello".

## PostgreSQL

We'll use PostgreSQL with our Rails application. Download and install from [here](http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload).

Once installed, be sure to use [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/download/) to create a super user with your terminal username and a blank password (empty string). This will allow Rails applications to use your terminal's credentials instead of the login information in the `database.yml` file (more on this later).

Rest assured, only local users will be able to connect to this postgres instance.

Your local username can be determined by looking in terminal or by running the following command:

```bash
whoami
```
