# Live Rails MVC Application from Scratch

Start with the skeleton built in [a previous lesson](7-rails-basics.md), call the application module *RailsMVC*.

* *Gemfile*: gems, including Rails
* *config.ru*: rack-based startup script
* *script/rails*: rails-based startup script
* *config/environment.rb*: application initialization
* *config/boot.rb*: application boot
* *config/application.rb*: application
* *config/initializers/secret_token.rb*: base cryptographic blob
* *public/index.html*: hello world

## Routes

A route connects an HTTP request with a controller. Routes are declared in *config/routes.rb*.

```ruby
RailsMVC::Application.routes.draw do
  # routes declared here
end
```

Default *RESTful* routing connects standard HTTP verbs (*GET*, *PUT*, *POST* and *DELETE*) with standard resource actions (`:index`, `:show`, `:new`, `:edit`, `:update` and `:destroy`).

## Rakefile

Tasks, such as database migrations, are written in [Rake](https://github.com/jimweirich/rake). Rake needs a *Rakefile*, which imports the application's code. Therefore, you have access to all domain models in Rake tasks.

```ruby
require File.expand_path('../config/application', __FILE__)

require 'rake'

RailsMVC::Application.load_tasks
```

You can run `rake -T` to see available tasks.

```bash
rake -T

rake about # List versions of all Rails frameworks and the environment
...
```

## Application Folder

Application code is located in *app*, by convention.

## Asset Pipeline

The *asset pipeline* enables authoring JavaScript, CSS and other static artifacts in many ways and compile or package them for the application. For example, in Rails 3.1 the asset pipeline enabled developers to write CoffeeScript instead of raw JavaScript out of the box.

Enable the application pipeline in *config/application.rb*.

```ruby
# Enable the asset pipeline
config.assets.enabled = true
```

Dynamic HTML in Rails is rendered with *templates*. Templates can be authored in multiple languages and execute Ruby code. Rails uses *ERB* by default. Another popular templating language is *HAML*. Add `haml-rails` to Gemfile and an application layout *app/views/layouts/application.html.haml*. A layout is a top-level template that defines the page structure, includes stylesheets and javascripts.

```haml
!!!
%html
  %head
    %title
      Rails MVC
    = stylesheet_link_tag "application"
    = javascript_include_tag "application"

  %body
    = yield
```

The `stylesheet_link_tag` and `javascript_include_tag` methods are declared in [ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/AssetTagHelper.html), which is the tip of the *asset pipeline*. While you can hardcode links in your templates, these functions work with the asset pipeline's concepts and let you add global settings, such as *asset host* for assets hosted externally on a CDN. It's pretty common for Rails applications to generate assets at build time and deploy these to a web server.

The asset pipeline has the concept of a *manifest file* which include *directives* to let rails know which files to include. Create
*app/assets/javascripts/application.js* - one of these *manifest files* with the following *directives*.

```js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require_tree .
```

Rails now ships with jQuery. Add `jquery-rails` to your Gemfile.

Add a stylesheet to *app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss*. The stylesheet is authored in SCSS, which is an extension of CSS that allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, etc.

```css
#error_explanation {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  h2 {
    background-color: #c00;
    color: #fff; 
  }
  ul li {
    font-size: 12px;
    list-style: square; 
  } 
}
```

## Database Configuration

Since we're using PostgreSQL we need `pg` in Gemfile.

Rails configuration files are authored in *YAML*, which executes Ruby code. You could, for example, reference an environment variable with `ENV['VARIABLE']`. Add *config/database.yml* for the database configuration. You can reuse blocks of configuration with `<<:`.

```yaml
common: &common
  adapter: postgresql
  username: rails
  password: password
  host: localhost
  port: 5432

development:
  <<: *common
  database: rails_development

test:
  <<: *common
  database: rails_test

production:
  <<: *common
  database: rails_production
```

If you run `rake -T` you'll notice that there are no database tasks. That's because we're only using the *action_controller* part of Rails. Change `require "action_controller/railtie"` in *config/application.rb* to include `rails/all`.

```ruby
require 'rails/all'
```

Re-run `rake -T` and make sure that database tasks are now displayed.

## Database Migrations

A database-backed application needs a schema. We could create *db/schema.rb* and populate it with a schema, but the Rails way is to use *database migrations*. Migrations support creating a new database and upgrading an existing one with built-in database versioning.

Create *db/migrate/1_create_things.rb*.

```ruby
class CreateThings < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :things do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

We  forgot the description. Let's create another migration to add this.

```bash
rails generate migration add_description_to_things description:string

  invoke  active_record
  create    db/migrate/20111207001110_add_description_to_things.rb
```

This should generate the following time-stamped migration file:

```ruby
class AddDescriptionToThings < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :things, :description, :string
  end
end
```

Migrations run incrementally in the order they were created, as determined by the number in the front of their filename.

## Local Database

Create a database and migrate it from empty to version 1.

```bash
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```

## Data Model

In Rails, *ActiveRecord* abstracts database access.

Create *app/models/thing.rb*.

```ruby
class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :name
  validates_uniqueness_of :name
end
```

The validators are a way to ensure presence and uniqueness of fields. The fields are automagically generated by querying the schema on application startup.

## Application Controller

All controllers inherit from `ActionController::Base`. It's a good idea to create an `ApplicationController` in *app/controllers/application_controller.rb* that can implement common logic, such as authentication, in the future.

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
end
```

## Things Controller

Add *app/controllers/things_controller.rb*.

```ruby
class ThingsController < ApplicationController
end
```

Retrieving all things for the index page.

```ruby
def index
  @things = Thing.all
end
```

Retrieve an existing thing by parameter when showing or editing a thing. The `params` hash has entries that can be accessed both by string and by symbol.

```ruby
def show
  @thing = Thing.find(params[:id])
end
```

Create a new thing when clicking on new.

```ruby
def new
  @thing = Thing.new
end
```

Persist a new or update an existing thing when submitting a thing from a new or edit page.

```ruby
def create
  @thing = Thing.new(params[:thing])
  if @thing.save
    redirect_to @thing, notice: 'Thing was successfully created.'
  else
    render action: "new"
  end
end

def update
  @thing = Thing.find(params[:id])
  if @thing.update_attributes(params[:thing])
    redirect_to @thing, notice: 'Thing was successfully updated.'
  else
    render action: "edit"
  end
end
```

Destroy a thing.

```ruby
def destroy
  @thing = Thing.find(params[:id])
  @thing.destroy
  redirect_to things_url
end
```

Errors are stored automatically via the model being saved, the controller's job is to re-render the view corresponding to the failed action. Create a partial *views/shared/_error_msg.html.haml* that will display errors.

```haml
- if model.errors.any?
  .error_explanation
    %h3= "#{pluralize(model.errors.count, "error")} saving #{model.class}:"
    %ul
      - model.errors.full_messages.each do |msg|
        %li= msg
```

The `:index`, `:show`, `:new`, `:edit`, `:update` and `:destroy` methods are called *actions*. These are the default for *RESTful* routing.

## Things View

Add *app/views/things/index.html.haml*.

```haml
%h1 Things

%table
  %tr
    %th= "Name"
    %th
    %th

  - @things.each do |thing|
    %tr
      %td= thing.name
      %td= link_to 'Edit', edit_thing_path(thing)
      %td= link_to 'Destroy', thing, :confirm => "Are you sure?", :method => :delete

= link_to "New Thing", new_thing_path
```

Rather than hardcoding an entire form, let's use a gem called [simple_form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) and make an edit form partial, *app/views/things/_form.html.haml*.

```haml
= simple_form_for @thing do |f|
  = render 'shared/error_msg', model: @thing
  = f.input :name
  = f.button :submit
```

The form can be used for the new thing in *app/views/things/new.html.haml*.

```haml
%h1 New Thing

= render 'form'

= link_to 'Back', things_path
```

It can also be used to edit a thing in *app/views/things/edit.html.haml*.

```haml
%h1= @thing.name

= render 'form'

= link_to 'Back', things_path
```

Finally, we should display a thing in *app/views/things/show.html.haml*.

```haml
%ul
  %li= "Name: #{@thing.name}"

= link_to 'Edit', edit_thing_path(@thing)
|
= link_to 'Back', things_path
```

## Things Routes

Edit *config/routes.rb*.

```ruby
RailsMVC::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :things
end
```

Review `rake routes`.

## Links

* [Rails Testing](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html)

## Exercise

* Add a set of unit tests for the Thing model that ensure that a Thing can be created, retrieved by id, updated and destroyed (CRUD).
* Add a set of functional tests for your things_controller that ensures Thing's CRUD.
* Add a set of functional view tests for the things view that ensure the view displays a list of things for the `:index` action, forms for `:edit`, contents of a thing on `:show`, etc.
* Bonus point for an integration test that runs a complete scenario of creating, showing, editing  updating and destroying a Thing object end-to-end.
* Bonus point for a route test.
