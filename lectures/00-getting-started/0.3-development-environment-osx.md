# Getting Started on Mac OS X

## Install SSH

OSX comes with an SSH client. Generate a public/private key pair.

```bash
ssh-keygen

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
```

Upload the public key (contents of ` ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to GitHub under [Account Settings, SSH Public Keys](https://github.com/account). Refer to [troubleshooting ssh issues](http://help.github.com/troubleshooting-ssh/) if you're having problems.

You should now be able to connect to GitHub.

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## Install Git

Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/download).

Configure your username and email.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
```

## Use a Code Editor

Most developers use Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Install and run it.

## Install Ruby w/ RVM

RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and it allows you to manage multiple versions of the Ruby development environment. This is useful for projects which call for an older version of Ruby itself or another core library. It also provides an easy way to restore your environment in the case it is damaged or mistakenly updated.

Install [RVM](https://rvm.io/).

```bash
gpg2 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB

\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```

Add RVM path and initialization command to your `.bash_profile`

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/rvm/bin
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"
```

Open a new shell and test RVM. The following should return `rvm is a function`.

```bash
$ type rvm | head -1 # numeral one
rvm is a function
```

Install Ruby 3.4.2.

```bash
rvm install 3.4.2
rvm --default 3.4.2
```

## Test Ruby

```bash
ruby -e "puts :Hello"
```

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager we'll use for a few components.

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSLk https://gist.github.com/raw/323731/install_homebrew.rb)"
```

See [installation instructions](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation) for any issues.

## PostgreSQL

We'll use PostgreSQL with our Rails application. Using `homebrew` shown above, run the following commands:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install postgresql
```

Upon completion, you will be shown a series of instructions. Follow the two instructions shown below:

```bash
If this is your first install, create a database with:
$ initdb /usr/local/var/postgres
```

```bash
If this is your first install, automatically load on login with:
$ mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
$ cp /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.1.2/org.postgresql.postgres.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
$ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.postgresql.postgres.plist
```

You will now have a postgresql database installed and running. The password for this database is an empty string (leave password field blank), and the username for this database will be your terminal's `username` as determined by the command:

```bash
whoami
```

Rest assured, only local users can connect to the postgresql instance. Since your terminal credentials has access to postgresql, username and password information will no longer be necessary in Rails' `database.yml` files (more on this later).

To display these instructions at any time, run the following command:

```bash
brew info postgresql
```

[pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/download/macosx.php) makes administering the postgresql instance easy and is recommended for new postgres users.
