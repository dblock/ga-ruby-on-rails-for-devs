Getting Started on Mac OSX
==========================

The following instructions are heavily inspired from [here](http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/).

Install Ssh
-----------

OSX comes with an SSH client. Generate a public/private key pair.

    $ ssh-keygen
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
    Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

Upload the public key (contents of ` ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to Github under [Account Settings, SSH Public Keys](https://github.com/account). Refer to [troubleshooting ssh issues](http://help.github.com/troubleshooting-ssh/) if you're having problems.

You should now be able to connect to Github.

    $ ssh -T git@github.com
    Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Install Git
-----------

Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/download).

Configure your username and email.

    git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
    git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

Build Essentials
----------------

Install XCode from [http://developer.apple.com/xcode/](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/). If you have an older version, such as [4.1](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=Developer_Tools/xcode_4.1_for_lion/xcode_4.1_for_lion.dmg), keep it.

Install Ruby w/ RVM
-------------------

RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and it allows you to manage multiple versions of the Ruby development environment. This is useful for projects which call for an older version of Ruby itself or another core library. It also provides an easy way to restore your environment in the case it is damaged or mistakenly updated.

Install [RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/).

    bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)

Add RVM path and initialization command to your `.bash_profile`

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/rvm/bin
    [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"

Open a new shell and test RVM. The following should return `rvm is a function`.

    $ type rvm | head -1 # numeral one
    rvm is a function

On OSX switch from the default C compiler to GCC.

    export CC="/usr/bin/gcc-4.2" 
    export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"
    export ARCHS="x86_64"

If GCC isn't working or you get errors compiling Ruby, reinstall GCC from [here](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer).
	
Install Ruby 2.6.5, RubyGems, Rails, and set up a gemset.

    rvm install 2.6.5
    rvm --default 2.6.5

Test Ruby
---------

    ruby -e "puts :Hello"

Install Homebrew
----------------

Homebrew is a package manager we'll use for a few components. It is highly recommended over MacPorts.

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSLk https://gist.github.com/raw/323731/install_homebrew.rb)"

See [installation instructions](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation) for any issues.

PostgreSQL
----------

We'll use PostgreSQL with our Rails application. Using `homebrew` shown above, run the following commands:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install postgresql

Upon completion, you will be shown a series of instructions. Follow the two instructions shown below:

    If this is your first install, create a database with:
    $ initdb /usr/local/var/postgres

.

    If this is your first install, automatically load on login with:
    $ mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    $ cp /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.1.2/org.postgresql.postgres.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    $ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.postgresql.postgres.plist

You will now have a postgresql database installed and running. The password for this database is an empty string (leave password field blank), and the username for this database will be your terminal's `username` as determined by the command:

    $ whoami

Rest assured, only local users can connect to the postgresql instance. Since your terminal credentials has access to postgresql, username and password information will no longer be necessary in Rails' `database.yml` files (more on this later).

To display these instructions at any time, run the following command:

    $ brew info postgresql

[pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/download/macosx.php) makes adminstrating the postgresql instance easy and is recommended for new postgres users.
