# User Authentication

We'll extend the application developed in [5.1 RSpec Refactor](https://github.com/dblock/class_RubyForDevs/tree/master/5-rspec/5.1-rspec-refactor-exercises) as a starting point.

Lets use [twitter-bootstrap-rails](https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails) for a prettier UI and add [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) to DRY up the specs.

```ruby
gem "twitter-bootstrap-rails"

group :development, :test do
  gem "shoulda-matchers"
end
```

Generate the Twitter bootstrap layout.

```bash
rails g bootstrap:install
```

## User Model

A basic model to store user's information.

```
rails generate model User name:string email:string
```

With validators. The regular expression to validate the e-mail was found on the Internet.

```ruby
class User
  attr_accessible :name, :email
  validates_uniqueness_of :email
  validates_presence_of :email
  validates :email, :format => { :with => /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i }
  validates_presence_of :name
end
```

Rails validators are useful to avoid malformed user data, but we also must enforce e-mail uniqueness in the database schema. Add a unique constraint to the `users` table in a database migration.

```bash
rails generate migration add_email_uniqueness_index
```

```ruby
class AddEmailUniquenessIndex < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    add_index :users, :email, :unique => true
  end
  def down
    remove_index :users, :email
  end
end
```

Create a basic form for a signing up a new user (copy from *thing*) and redirect signup to a new user action in *config/routes.rb*.

```ruby
match '/signup',  :to => 'users#new'
```

## Password

Enforce a minimum and a maximum length with confirmation, but don't store the password in the database.

```ruby
validates :password, :presence => true, :confirmation => true, :length => { :within => 6..40 }

attr_accessible :password_hash
attr_accessor :password, :password_confirmation
```

The password hash will be the only one stored.

```
rails generate migration add_password_to_users password_hash:string
```

Before a user is saved, generate an password hash.

```ruby
before_save :hash_password

private

  def hash_password
    self.password_hash = ::User.hash(self.password)
  end

  def self.hash(string)
    Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(string)
  end
```

We can also write a method that checks whether the password is correct.

```ruby
def has_password?(pwd)
  self.password_hash == ::User.hash(pwd)
end
```

Add the password field to the sign-up form in *views/users/_form.html.haml*.

```haml
= simple_form_for @user do |f|
  = render 'shared/error_msg', model: @user
  = f.input :name
  = f.input :email
  = f.input :password
  = f.input :password_confirmation
  = f.button :submit
```

## RESTful Session

We can think of a login as a resource. After a user enters a valid e-mail and password, the application will create a new session and will destroy it to logout.

Lets start with a view to enter an e-mail and password in *app/views/sessions/new.html.haml*. We don't have a session yet, so we can use a `:session` symbol. The form will be posted to the `:create` action of the `SessionsController`.

```haml
= simple_form_for :session, :url => sessions_path do |f|
  = f.input :email
  = f.input :password
  = f.button :submit, :value => "Sign In"
```

The controller.

```ruby
class SessionsController < ApplicationController

  def new
    # sign-in form
  end

  def create
    # sign-in form posted, log-in
  end

  def destroy
    # user loging out
  end

end
```

Sessions routes. We can create more readable routes as well.

```ruby
resources :sessions, :only => [:new, :create, :destroy]

match '/signup',  :to => 'users#new'
match '/signin',  :to => 'sessions#new'
match '/signout', :to => 'sessions#destroy'
```

We'll want to access session information in multiple controllers, therefore we will create *app/helpers/session_helper.rb*.

```ruby
module SessionsHelper

  def sign_in(user)
    # log-in an existing user
  end

  def sign_out
    # logout current user
  end

  def signed_in?
    # true if signed in
  end

  def current_user
    # current user, if any
  end

end
```

## Redirect to Login

An unauthenticated user will be redirected to login.

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include SessionsHelper

  before_filter :authenticate

  def authenticate
    redirect_to :signin unless signed_in?
  end

end
```

We're redirecting to the `SessionsController`, which shouldn't try to authenticate users.

## Remove the Last Static Page

Add a `HomeController` and a view that shows the current user.

```haml
%h1 Hello World

You're logged in as
=current_user
```

Redirect the root of the application to this controller.

```ruby
    root :to => "home#index"
```

## Session Helper

We would like to group session management functions, such as `current_user`, in a standalone module that can be tested independently and used from multiple controllers.

```ruby
module SessionsHelper

  def sign_in(user)
    cookies.permanent.signed[:auth_token] = [user.id, user.cookie]
    self.current_user = user
  end

  def sign_out
    cookies.delete :auth_token
    self.current_user = nil
  end

  def signed_in?
    ! current_user.nil?
  end

  def current_user
    @current_user ||= user_from_cookie
  end

  def current_user=(user)
    @current_user = user
  end

  private

    def user_from_cookie
      User.authenticate_with_cookie(* remember_token)
    end

    def remember_token
      cookies.signed[:auth_token] || [nil, nil]
    end

end
```

The `cookies` method belongs to `ActionController` and will provide one with an interface for persisting and manipulating cookies in a client's browser. For more information on the cookies interface, see [here](http://apidock.com/rails/ActionDispatch/Cookies)

## User

Given an e-mail and a password, locate an existing `User`.

```ruby
def self.authenticate(email, pwd)
  user = find_by_email(email)
  return nil  if user.nil?
  return user if user.has_password?(pwd)
end
```

Given a user ID and a cookie, locate an existing `User`.

```ruby
def self.authenticate_with_cookie(id, cookie)
  user = find_by_id(id)
  user && user.has_password?(cookie) ? user : nil
end
```

## User Controller

Allow registering new users by disabling authentication on the `:new` and `:create` routes. Otherwise the browser would be redirected to a login page.

```ruby
skip_filter :authenticate, :only => [ :new, :create ]
```

## Sessions Controller w/ Login

Allow logging in by disabling authentication on the `:new` and `:create` routes. Otherwise the browser would be redirected to a login page. A new session is established after looking up a user by e-mail and password.

```ruby
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  skip_filter :authenticate, only: [ :new, :create ]

  def new
    render 'new'
  end

  def create
    user = User.authenticate(params[:session][:email], params[:session][:password])
    if user.nil?
      flash.now[:error] = "Invalid email/password combination."
      render 'new'
    else
      sign_in user
      redirect_to user
    end
  end

  def destroy
    sign_out
    redirect_to root_path
  end

end
```

## Logout Link

The logout link destroys the current session.

```haml
=link_to "Sign Out", signout_path, :method => :delete
```
