# HAML

[HAML](http://haml-lang.com) is, and is an acronym for, an *HTML Abstraction Markup Language*.

HAML avoids the need for explicitly coding HTML into the template, because it itself is a description of the HTML, with some code to generate dynamic content.

## HTML in HAML

```ruby
require 'haml'

s = "Ruby String"

e = Haml::Engine.new "%p Hello World"

e.render # "<p>Hello World</p>"
```

Indentation matters in HAML. It allows the parser to cleverly close our tags without being explicitly told to do so. Two spaces per indent is the rule. 

* The first non-whitespace character of each line is what is used to decide how to parse the line
* HTML tags open with `%`
* HTML comments start with `/`
* Divs with an ID start with `#`
* Divs with a class start with `.`
* Doctype declaration is `!!!`

Example:

```haml
!!!
%html
  %head
    %title HAML Example
  %body
    / a paragraph of class intro        
    %p.intro
      An Introduction to HAML          
    / a div with id=links and class bottom
    #links.bottom
      %a{ href: "http://generalassemb.ly" } GeneralAssemb.ly
    / a div with class footer and left
    .footer.left
      built at GeneralAssemb.ly
```

## Mixing with Ruby

Text after an `=` sign is the result of Ruby code, text after `-` evaluates Ruby code.

```haml
%ul
  -(1..5).each do |i|
    %li= i
```

## Binding

Render accepts an *Object*, *Proc*, etc. 

```ruby
require 'haml'

class Hound
  def initialize
    @sound = "bow wow"
  end
  def public_binding
    binding
  end
end

t = %q{
= "The dog says #{@sound}"
}

dog = Hound.new
Haml::Engine.new(t).render(dog.public_binding)
```
