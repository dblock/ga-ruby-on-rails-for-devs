# Pivotal Tracker

We'll use [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) for tracking exercises and assignments.

* Give a work item 1, 2 or 3 points depending on the level of difficulty you estimate the work item is.
* *Start* a work item when you begin working on it.
* *Finish* a work item when you have committed code into GitHub.
* *Deliver* the work item when you want your instructor to look at it.
* Your instructor will *Accept* or *Reject* an assignment. You can *Restart* rejected assignments.
