# Ruby Basics

## Objective

Learn the basics of Ruby focusing on concepts that differentiate it from other languages.

## Hello World

From now on, we will create Ruby source code files (e.g. `hello.rb`), add Ruby code to them, and execute it with `ruby` on the terminal.

```ruby
# comments start with a pound sign

puts "Hello World"
```

```bash
$ ruby hello.rb

Hello World
```

## Strings

Strings in Ruby can be single or double-quoted and are instances of a class called `String`. In Ruby, everything is a class, not a type.

```ruby
Class.class # => Class
String.class # => Class

"Hello World".class # => String
'Hello World'.class # => String
```

Variables can be declared anywhere and Ruby does not have type checking built-in by default. Double-quoted strings allow interpolating values with `#{}`, single quoted strings do not.

```ruby
world = "World"

"Hello #{world}" # => Hello World
'Hello #{world}' # => Hello #{world}
```

You can declare strings with line breaks with the `<<~` syntax (the `~` is optional), called a _heredoc_, or with the `%q` syntax which is followed by a delimited block within `{}` or `|`. In the following example `EOS` is a start and end _marker_. Heredoc allows you to specify a string as a block of text maintaining indentation and line breaks.

```ruby
s = <<-EOS
 Line 1
 Line 2
EOS

s = %q|
 Line 1
 Line 2
|
```

## Exercise

Find two ways to print out "Hello World" in quotes.

``` ruby
"Hello World"
"Hello World"
```

## Methods

Objects have methods. In Ruby these are called _messages_, but for now they behave just like you'd expect methods to behave. For example, `String` has a method called `downcase`.

```ruby
"Hello World".downcase # => "hello world"
```

Methods are declared with `def` and `return` is implicit.

```ruby
def downcase(s)
  s.downcase
end

downcase("Hello World") # hello world
```

Methods can return multiple values.

```ruby
def downcase_and_count(s)
  return s.downcase, s.length # or [s.downcase, s.length] without a return
end

downcased, len = downcase_and_count("Hello World")

downcased # => "hello world"
len # => 11
```

If you don't need one of the returned values, the common convention is to assign it to `_`, or a variable prefixed with `_` (e.g. `_downcased`).

```ruby
_, len = downcase_and_count("Hello World")

len # 11
```

Manipulating objects, in general, returns copies of those objects.

```ruby
s = "Hello World"
s.downcase # => "hello world"
s # => "Hello World", unchanged
```

Operations with a bang (`!`) have consequences, i.e., they mutate the receiving object without creating new copies.

```ruby
s = "Hello World"
s.downcase! # => "hello world"
s # => "hello world", changed
```

Operations with a question mark (`?`) typically return `true` or `false`.

```ruby
1.nil? # => false
nil.nil? # => true
"".empty? # => true
```

When rescuing exceptions, it's best practice to rescue specific exception types rather than the generic `Exception` class.

Parameters in Ruby are passed by value, but all values are references to an `Object`. This can be confusing.

For example, when passing an `Integer` into a method you cannot modify the caller's variable. There are no methods that modify an `Integer` in place, and any assignment to it changes the reference to a new object.

```ruby
def increment(n)
  n = n + 1
end

n = 1
increment(n) # => 2
n # => 1
```

Passing a `String` can modify the caller's `String` because the actual object is being modified in-place.

```ruby
def downcase(s)
  s.downcase!
end

s = "Hello World"
downcase(s) # => "hello world"
s # => "hello world"
```

## Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are built-in.

```ruby
"Hello World" =~ /World/ # => 6, it's a match at character number 6
```

## Loops

Ruby has a concept of an enumerator called `Range`. In the following example, `1..5` creates an inclusive range from 1 to 5, and `1...5` a range that doesn't include 5.

```ruby
(1..5).class # => Range
(1..5).to_a # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
(1...5).to_a # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

A simple `for` loop iterates over each element of a range, but is not idiomatic Ruby. Instead, methods such as `each`, `map`, or `select` are preferred.

```ruby
# a simple loop
for i in 1..5
  puts i
end
```

A more idiomatic version uses the `each` iterator. The following loop takes a so called _block_ (everything after `do`). 

```ruby
# a loop over a range
(1..5).each do |i|
  puts i
end
```

Ruby has several ways to express concepts such as ranges or operations in plain English, e.g. `times`.

```ruby
5.times # => #<Enumerator: 5:times>
```

The following example executes a block 5 times, starting at 0.

```ruby
5.times do |i|
  puts i
end
```

By now you are probably beginning to love Ruby's `end` keyword.

## Exercise

Implement a loop that prints odd numbers under 10.

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

## True, False, Conditionals and Branches

Conditionals in Ruby can be _truthy_ and _falsey_. Most things are `true`, except `nil`, and `false`. 

```ruby
if true
  puts "true"
end
```

Use `!!`, a double-negation, to convert anything to `true` or `false`. Note that `0` is truthy.

```ruby
!! true # => true
!! 0 # => true, this is surprising
!! 1 # => true
!! "" # => true
!! "hello" # => true

!! nil # => false
!! false # => false
```

Both `if` and `unless` can be used on the right hand side.

```ruby
puts "true" if true # => true
puts "true" unless false # => true
```

It's common to check for `nil?` explicitly. A similar pattern is used in Strings with methods such as `empty?`, or Integers with methods such as `positive?`.

```ruby
puts "empty" if "".empty? # => empty
puts "nil" if nil.nil? # => nil
puts "positive" if 1.positive? # => positive
```

If-then-else can be abbreviated as `elsif`.

```ruby
if 2 + 2 == 5
  puts "2+2 is 5"
elsif 2 + 2 == 4
  puts "2+2 is 4"
else
  puts "2+2 is something else"
end
```

The `case` keyword will evaluate the argument once. The value of `when` can contain an expression or even items of different types.

```ruby
case 2 + 2
when 3 + 2 then puts "2+2 is 5"
when 4 then puts "2+2 is 4"
when "green" then puts "2+2 is green"
else puts "2+2 is something else"
end
```

Note that Ruby doesn't have a `Boolean` class, instead `true` and `false` are instances of `TrueClass` and `FalseClass`.

```ruby
true.class # => TrueClass
false.class # => FalseClass
```

## Containers

You can loop over items in a container, often referred to as an _array_. Arrays may include objects of any type.

```ruby
[ "rouge", 1, (1..5) ].each do |i|
  puts "#{i} (#{i.class})"
end

=begin (a multiline comment)

rouge (String)
1 (Integer)
1..5 (Range)

end
```

Arrays are indexed from both ends, and it's allowed to access an object outside of the range.

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

numbers[0] # => 1
numbers[-1] # => 3
numbers[5] # => nil
```

All `nil` entries are, naturally, instances of `NilClass`.

```ruby
numbers[5].class # => NilClass
```

Arrays have many useful methods that enable chaining, such as `compact`.

```ruby
[ 1, nil, 3, 5 ].compact # => [ 1, 3, 5]
```

Nested arrays can be flattened.

```ruby
[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3 ], [], 4 ].flatten # => [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

## Exercise

Implement a `case` statement that displays whether an element of the following array is an odd number, even number or a letter: [ 1, 7, 'A', 2, 'Z' ]

```
1: odd number
7: odd number
A: letter
2: even number
Z: letter
```

## Hashes

A dictionary is commonly referred to as a _hash_.

```ruby
{ 
  red: "rouge",
  yellow: "jaune"
} # => { :red => "rouge", :yellow => "jaune" }
```

The use of `:` in the declaration above marks a _bareword_ or a string as a `Symbol`, i.e. globally unique objects. All of the following examples produce identical results where the key is a `Symbol`, and there's no difference between two uses of `:red` and `:red`.

```ruby
{ red: "red" }
{ "red": "red" }
{ :red => "red" } # deprecated Ruby 1.8.x syntax
{ :"red" => "red" } # deprecated Ruby 1.8.x syntax
```

In contrast, using a hash key (`=>`) denotes a hash key that can be any object. In that case two identical strings `"red"` and `"red"` may not necessarily be the same object.

```ruby
{ "red" => "red" } # the key is a String
{ 1 => "red" } # the key is an Integer
```

Access items in a hash with `[]`.

```ruby
h = { 
  red: "rouge",
  yellow: "jaune"
}

h[:red] # "rouge"
```

Iterate over items in a hash with `each_pair`, which yields both a key and value.

```ruby
hash.each_pair do |key, value|
  puts "#{key}: #{value}"
end
```

Hash keys and values can be of any type. It's common to use globally unique symbols (e.g. `:symbol`) for a hash keys.

```ruby
hash = { 
  red: { french: "rouge", russian: "красный" },
  yellow: { french: "jaune", russian: "жёлтый" }
}

hash.each_pair do |key, value|
  puts "#{key} #{value[:french]}"
end
```

You can access nested hashes directly.

```ruby
hash[:red][:russian] # => "красный"
```

Be careful when passing `Hash` parameters. A common mistake of forgetting to duplicate a `Hash` can cause unexpected side-effects.

```ruby
def print_info(person)
  name = person.delete(:name)
  puts "#{name} is an #{person[:role]}"
end

person = { name: 'Daniel', role: 'instructor' }
print_info(person) # => "Daniel is an instructor"
print_info(person) # => " is an instructor"
```

To prevent side effects you can `dup` or `clone` a hash.

```ruby
def print_info(person)
  person = person.dup
  name = person.delete(:name)
  puts "#{name} is a #{person[:role]}"
end

person = { name: 'Daniel', role: 'instructor' }
print_info(person) # => Daniel is an instructor
print_info(person) # => Daniel is an instructor
```

## Mapping

Use `map` to apply a block to each element and returns a new collection.

```ruby
[ 1, 2 ].map { |i| i * 2 } # => [2, 4]

[ 1, nil, 3, 5 ].map { |i| i.nil? } # => [false, true, false, false]
```

## Reducing

Use `reduce` to accumulate a value. The following example sums up all elements of an array.

```ruby
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ].reduce(0) { |result, element| result + element } # => 10
```

## Tapping

Ruby has a unique method `tap` that helps reuse values by calling a block and returning the object being tapped. This can be useful to inspect a value in a chain of events. Consider the following code.

```ruby
(1..10).
  select { |x| x%2 == 0 }.
  map    { |x| x*x } # => [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

Adding `.tap` can help display intermediate values.

```ruby
(1..10).
  tap { |x| puts "Enumerable: #{x}" }.
  select { |x| x%2 == 0 }.
  tap { |x| puts "Evens: #{x}" }.
  map    { |x| x*x }.
  tap { |x| puts "Squares: #{x}" } # => [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

The code above prints the values of all intermediate steps.

```
Enumerable: 1..10
Evens: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Squares: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

## Operators

To raise a number into a power, use `**`.

```ruby
3 ** 2 # => 9
```

Ruby often has several different operators or methods that accomplish the same thing. Both the `<<` operator and the `push` method add an item to an array.

```ruby
[1, 2].push 3 # => [1, 2, 3]

[1, 2] << 3 # => [1, 2, 3]
```

The `||` operator checks whether a value is `nil` or `false`, and if so returns the right hand value.

```ruby
nil || "empty" # => "empty"

false || "value" # => "value"
```

The `||=` operator will create and assign a variable only if it is nil or undefined.

```ruby
variable ||= "memoized string"
variable # => "memoized string"
```

Ruby naturally offers ternary operators.

```ruby
1.positive? ? "positive" : "negative" # => positive
```

Next, let's look at [Ruby OOP](2.2-ruby-oop.md).
