# Why Ruby?

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/) was created by [Yukihiro Matsumoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) in 1995. Matz's motto is MINSWAN = "Matz Is Nice So We Are Nice".

We love Ruby because it is a powerful language that focuses on developer happiness. The Ruby ecosystem has attracted some of the nicest people in the development community. In software development people matter most.
