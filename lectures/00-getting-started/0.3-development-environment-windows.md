# Getting Started on Windows

The following instructions are heavily inspired from [here](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/).

## Install Ssh

Install [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) and manually start `pageant`. 

Generate a private/public key pair using `puttygen` and load it in `pageant`. 

Set `GIT_SSH=c:\Program Files\PuTTY\plink.exe`. 

## Install Git

Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/download).

Configure your username and email.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
```

## Install Ruby

Download a Ruby installer from [the website](http://rubyonrails.org/download "Download Ruby"). Run it.

## Test Ruby

```bash
ruby -e "puts :Hello"
```

## Use a Code Editor

Most developers use Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Install and run it.

## Installing Ruby Development Kit
	
Install the Ruby Development Kit. This allows you to install various bundles with native extensions. Download it from [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and extract it into a new folder. Run `devkitvars.bat` to setup an environment. 

## PostgreSQL

We'll use PostgreSQL with our Rails application. Install from [here](http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).

Once installed, be sure to use [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/download/) to create a super user with your Window's username and a blank password (empty string). This will allow Rails applications to use your terminal's credentials instead of the login information in the `database.yml` file (more on this later).

Rest assured, only local users will be able to connect to this postgres instance.

Your local username can be determined by looking in User Accounts in Control Panel.
