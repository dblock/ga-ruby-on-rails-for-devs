# ERB

[ERB](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html) stands for *Embedded Ruby*. It's a templating system for Ruby.

## File Extensions

The `html.erb` or `erb.html` file extensions indicates that you can mix HTML, ERB and pure Ruby code in the same file. Some projects use `.rhtml`.
		
## Evaluating ERB

ERB is just a Ruby module, so you can evaluate ERB inline in Ruby code. To evaluate Ruby inside an ERB string use `<% %>`. To output a value, use `<%= %>`. Comments can be placed inside `<%# .. %>`.

```ruby
require 'erb'

s = "Ruby String"
e = ERB.new "<%= s %>"

e.result # "Ruby String"
```

In Ruby strings can be declared on multiple lines with `<<-` or with `%q`. 

``` erb
<%# prints ERB is a Class %>
ERB is a <%= ERB.class.name %>
<%# prints value of string %>
String is <%= s %>
```

Ruby code inside ERB templates can, for example, iterate over an array.

```ruby
animals = {
  "cow" => "moo",
  "cat" => "meow"
}

t = %q{

  The animals at the zoo:

  <% animals.each_pair do |animal, sound| %>
    * <%= animal %> says <%= sound %>
  <% end %>
}

ERB.new(t).result
```

## Binding

`ERB.result` can take an optional `binding` which provides access to local variables. This is how it is possible to access local variables from the controller in an ERB view.

``` ruby
require 'erb'

class Hound
  def initialize
    @sound = "bow wow"
  end
  def public_binding
    binding
  end
end

t = %q{
  The dog says: <%= @sound %>
}

dog = Hound.new

ERB.new(t).result(dog.public_binding) # The dog says: bow wow
```
